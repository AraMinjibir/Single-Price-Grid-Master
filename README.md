# Single-Price-Grid-Master
This was among the challenges I accepted from Frontend Mentor's challenges.
It was designed to manifest my proficiency in basics of HTML and CSS. The design was for two distinct viewers.
1. Desktop Viewers this is for those who are using Desktops and Laptops. The width and height was designed to align with their sizes.
2. Mobile Viewers this is for those that are using mobile phones, they have theirs too.

The sizes for both Desktops and Laptops were given from the Instructor, those that were not explicitly stated I used Viewport width and height.
